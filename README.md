# Simple Task Editor

Todo for the Groups branch are:
- [x] Handle unsaved tasks for each group
- [x] Handle note.content.unsavedTask if coming from legacy environment, by associating to default group.
- [ ] Make groups in the interface re-orderable.
- [ ] Ability to collapse a group (and save that collapsed state in the text somehow).
- [ ] Can create new group, but pressing button again doesn't create more.
- [ ] Group names need to be editable.
